\chapter*{Preface}

% Some people like to put in a little quote (Knuth in particular loves this)

\begin{quote}
\noindent\textit{Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.}

\hspace{2cm}--- Mahatma Gandhi
\end{quote}

Much of the front matter is optional. In particular, include things like a Dedication, List of Figures, List of Tables, List of Algorithms, only if there are enough of them to justify it and it would help the reader.
