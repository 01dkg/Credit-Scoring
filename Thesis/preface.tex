\chapter*{Preface}

% Some people like to put in a little quote (Knuth in particular loves this)

\begin{quote}
\noindent\textit{Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.}

\hspace{2cm}--- Mahatma Gandhi
\end{quote}

The basis for this practicum stemmed from our passion towards data exploration, pattern finding and development of new solutions. Data visualisation has been always of our interest, hence, this practicum presents an interactive visualisation. It is our passion to develop interactive dashboards and serve deep insights to all types of users. We could not have achieved success of our practicum without the constant help and support from our academic supervisor Dr. Peter Keenan and business supervisor Mr. Selwyn Hearns. We faced challenges while doing the research, but doing aggressive investigation has helped us to find answers to our questions. Research of this practicum has given us an opportunity to broaden our knowledge area towards data analysis and optimisation of problems.
