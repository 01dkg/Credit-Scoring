# Enhancing Credit Analysis and Assessment using Geo Spatial Techniques

This practicum presents interactive dashboard for enhancing credit analysis

and assessment using GeoSpatial techniques for Irish residential properties de-
veloped by data from following sources (i) loan portfolios and credit data (ii)

property price register (iii) Central Statistical Office. These analyses can be
used to reduce the chances of financial loss on a residential mortgage.
The predictive model is built on logistic regression and decision tree algorithms
and produces an estimated default probability of the applicant. Models are

built on normalised data to cover all possible scenarios from real life. The pre-
dictive probability will determine good and bad customers by classifying them

into four categories. The output from predictive models is used on tableau to

generate business dashboard. Models ability to classify and performance mea-
surements were measured by using statistical metrics: Gini, KS and AUROC.

Results showed that decision tree has much better performance than logistic
regression.
